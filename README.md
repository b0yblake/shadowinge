## How it works?

At first, your link/audio/samples will be auto-generate by [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) The transcription will load in real-time alongside your media, allowing you to follow along and shadow as you progress.

The **Shadowinge.fun** uses [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) – the speech recognition toolkit, to analyze your voice recordings and determine what you're trying to say.

Audio recording by [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), encoded into WAV format by [WebAudioRecorder.js](https://github.com/higuma/web-audio-recorder-js) library.

## How to use?






## Acknowledge

The speech score provided by this tool is based on the confidence score of each word provided by Vosk's model.

The pronunciation data is provided by [The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).

The speech examples are collected from the [Random Sentence Generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/sentence.php) website.
